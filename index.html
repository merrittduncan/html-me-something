        <h4><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
        <p>
            <i>I took a translation seminar a few years ago and this was my final portfolio.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            In evaluating Francis Ponge's <i>Le Parti pris des choses</i>, I found the workshops of my piece led to the biggest amendements I made to the text, often disregarding the original French. Although many directly translated phrases from French
            can be beautiful in a literary, near-stilted manner, when this tone is present throughout every sentence, the playfulness of Ponge seems to get lost. I think Ponge is, in some way, expressing himself in an ironically academic way. Simply the
            manner he goes about closely investigating these overlooked objects or animals is humourous. But if the original French structures were kept throughout the piece, it would seem too self-serious, with the sarcasm not coming through.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading the piece for clarity in English allowed for the certain moments to relax and perhaps for an English reader to come closer to the piece. I am a reader of poetry with a hyper-critical eye for pretension, generalization and unclear images. It is
            precisely because of these tastes that I found Ponge to be so approachable. From its prose-like structure to the whimsical subject matter, at no point does an alarm start ringing in my head “I am reading a poem!” that causes me to get all
            serious and stop enjoying myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Retaining the ease of Ponge in French was difficult to master in English, especially at the beginning stages when I was so tied to the original. I struggled with many difficulties, from the common French language problems of lengthy possession tags (“shoes
            of a vagabond” vs “vagabond’s shoes”) and even lengthier sentences, with strange colons, dashes and half a dozen commas, to a word choice particular to Ponge. I do not feel that I am proficient in French enough to recognize every idiomatic
            phrase, or to understand the many implications to one word. So when presented with a word like “nuageuese” in reference to fruit, I was stuck. Was Ponge really calling the fruit “cloudy,” or does that have another meaning in French? I tried
            to consider what a cloud is like, what Ponge could possibly be referring to. The best I could come up with was “toothsome,” a positive association I thought that Ponge was heading for in his sentence. Later, in class, I was told that the word
            “nuageuese” was as out-of-place in the French as it seemed in English. So despite my attachment to the phrase “luscious or toothsome commodities” I changed it back to the more literal translation. Suddenly the meaning of this sentence had
            changed dramatically. The fruits were not always so appealing. They could be luscious, they could be cloudy (which I understood as perhaps bruised or discolored), but in any case, they would last longer than <i>le cageot</i> that
            housed them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This particular poem led me to decide whether I should retain the original French of <i>le cage</i>, <i>cachot</i> and <i>cageot</i>. There was some discussion of this in the workshop, but ultimately I decided not to translate these terms
            into English. The actual merging of the letters and sounds of <i>cage</i> and <i>cachot</i> to create <i>cageot</i> is simply not reproducible in English, and it was a delightful “trick” that I appreciated too much to let go. Furthermore,
            as the Ponge poem is so closely describing this object, I thought leaving it as an untranslatable word would only increase the fun in figuring out what the fuck Ponge is talking about.
        </p>
        <p>
            For my portfolio, I also rearranged the poems in a way that I thought might make a logical progression. I alternated between longer and shorter pieces, and ended with “Snails.” This final poem is one of Ponge’s works that spins out into a much larger
            treatise on humanity. In contrast to his short description of le cageot, where Ponge clearly stops himself from dwelling any longer on this disposable object, “Snails” grasps at concepts that one would never think of when at first considering
            a snail. Even these lofty ideals seem to be set forth tongue-in-cheek, but I felt that unless a reader had become accustomed to Ponge’s humor (say, through seven other poems), this sarcasm might be misunderstood.

            <h4><a name="autumn">THE END OF AUTUMN</a></h4>
            <p>
                Autumn, at its finish, is nothing more than cold tea. The dead leaves of all varieties macerate in the rain. No fermentation, no creation of alcohol: it is necessary to wait until spring to see how the compresses did on a pegleg.
            </p>
            <p>
                The counting becomes disorderly. All the doors of the polling booths bang violently, opening and closing. Throw it out, throw it out! Nature rips up her manuscripts, demolishes the library, and shakes out her last fruits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, she rises brusquely from her desk. Her stature soon seems immense, with her head in a mist and her hair undone. Arms dangling, she delightedly inhales the cold wind that refreshes her ideas. The days are short, the night falls fast, the upside loses
                its consideration.
            </p>
            <p>
                The earth, in the galaxy among the other stars, resumes her serious air. She is narrowly illuminated, infiltrated by shadowed valleys. Her shoes, like a vagabond’s, penetrate the water and make music.
            </p>
            <p>

                In this marsh, this healthy amphibiguity, everything resumes its forces: jumping from stone to stone and altering the meadow. The streams multiply.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we have what is called a great cleansing that has no respect for conventions! Dressed in the nude, soaked to the bone.
            </p>
            <p>
                And it lasts, it does not dry quickly. Three months of healthy reflection in this state; without a vascular reaction, without a robe or a loofah. But her strong constitution resists all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, when the little buds start to point again, they know what they are and to what they will return – and if they show themselves with caution, numbed and ruddy, it is with a knowledge of the cause.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there starts another story, that depends perhaps on the odor of a black regulation that pulls my train of thought beneath itself.

            <h4><a name="fishermen">POOR FISHERMEN</a></h4>
            <p>
                Although short of haulers, two chains are still unceasingly pulled towards the the impasse on King’s Canal. A brood of brats in the middle cry near the baskets: “Poor fishermen!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the account as reported by the streetlamps: “Half of the fish lost by somersaulting on the sand, and three-quarters of the crabs returned towards the sea.”
            </p>

            <h4><a name="gymnast">THE GYMNAST</a></h4>
            <p>
                Like a “G” indicates, the gymnast has a goatee and a moustache that almost join a heavy lock of curly hair on a low forehead.
            </p>
            <p>
                Molded in a leotard that makes two creases in the groin, he wears it like a “Y,” with the tail to the left. He devastates all hearts, but must remain chaste and swear only “BASTA!” Pinker than nature and less adroit than a monkey, he leaps at the gear,
                seized with a pure zeal. Then, with his head caught in a knotted rope, he interrogates the air like a worm from its hole. To finish, he sometimes chooses to hang like a caterpillar, but rebounds onto his feet, and then he is the adored
                paragon of human stupidity that you salute.

            <h4><a name="cageot">LE CAGEOT</a></h4>

            <p>
                In between la cage and le cachot, the French language has le cageot, a simple, slatted box that is dedicated to transporting those fruits that would fall ill at the lightest suffocation.
            </P>
            <p>
                At the end of its employment, it is arranged in a way that can be broken with no effort and cannot be used twice. In this way, it lasts even less time than the luscious or cloudy commodities that it contains.</p>
            <p>
                At every street corner next to a market, there shines, without vanity, a shock of white wood. Still fresh, and slightly stunned to be in such an awkward position, it is thrown onto the road with no return. This object is completely sympathetic, but the
                sort that conveniences us not to dwell upon for very long.</P>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h4><a name="orange">THE ORANGE</a></h4>
            <p>
                Like the sponge, the orange aspires to resume its capacity after having sustained the proof of its expression. But while the sponge always succeeds, the orange never does: for its cells are erupted, its tissues rent. Although its peel alone softly reestablishes
                its form through its elasticity, an amber liquid is spilled. This is accompanied with refreshment and a sweet perfume, certainly – but also frequently with the bitter conscience of a premature expulsion of seeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Must we choose a side between these two ways of oppression? The sponge is nothing but a muscle that fills with air, clean water, or dirty water accordingly: this gymnastic is ignoble. The orange has a better taste, but she is more passive, and this redolent
                sacrifice... it is how the oppressor truly comes out ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is not enough said of the orange if only recalling the particular fashion of perfuming the air and delighting its tormentor. One must highlight the resulting liquid’s glorious coloration, and, better than the juice of a lemon, the orange obliges
                the larynx to open itself widely, as though pronouncing a word, when ingesting its liquid, but without a single apprehensive pout of the lips that ruffles the tastebuds.
            </p>
            <P>
                And for the rest, we have no words to confess our admiration for the envelope of the tender, fragile and pink oval, a thick, damp blotter within a thinner yet pigmented skin, flavored acerbically, and just ruddy enough to catch the light with dignity
                over its perfect fruit form.
            </P>
            <p>
                But in the end of this short study, conducted as roundly as possible – it is necessary to return to the seed. This grain, in the form of a miniscule lemon, offers on its exterior the color of the white wood of a lemon tree, and in its interior the green
                of a pea or a tender sprout. It is within this that we find, after the sensational explosion of the Venetian lantern of flavors, colors and smells that constitute the fruit itself – the relative hardness and the verdancy (not entirely
                tasteless, moreover) of the tree, of the branch, of the leaf: all in all so tiny, although certainly the reason for the fruit’s being.

            <h4><a name="fern">FERN RUM</a></h4>
            <p>
                From beneath the ferns and their pretty daughters, do I have a Brazilian perspective?
            </p>
            <p>
                Wood neither for construction, nor for matchsticks; but some species of leaves piled on the ground that an old rum has moistened.
            </p>
            <p>
                When growing, some stems in shortened pulses, some prodigal virgins without guardians: a vast drunkenness of palms having lost all control, each hiding two thirds of the sky.

            <h4><a name="cigarette">THE CIGARETTE</a></h4>
            <P>
                First the atmosphere is rendered both misty and dry, disheveled, wherever the always-askew cigarette continuously creates it.
            </P>
            <P>
                Then the body: a little torch that is less luminous than it is perfumed, detached and pampered according to a rhythm that is determined by a calculated number of small ash heaps.
            </P>
            <P>
                The final passion: this burning button, peeling in silvery dandruff, forms an immediate mantle of more recent surroundings.
            </P>
        </article>
        <article>

            <h4><a name="snails">SNAILS</a></h4>
            <P>
                In contrast to the ash that is the host of hot cinders, snails love the moist soil. Go on, they advance, sticking to it with their entire bodies. They bring it with them, they eat it, they excrete it. It passes through them. They pass through it. It’s
                an interpenetration of the best kind because the tones match in this way – with a passive element, an active element, the passive bathing and nourishing the active each time – it moves while it eats.
            </P>
            <P>
                (There are other things to say about snails. First, their own humidity. Their composure. Their stretchability.)
            </P>
            <P>
                Note also that we cannot conceive of a snail out of its shell and unmoving. As soon as he rests, he returns to himself at once. No, his modesty obliges him to move as soon as he shows his nudity, as soon as he uncovers his vulnerable form. Once he’s exposed,
                he moves on.
            </P>
            <P>
                During the dry times, they retire in their trenches where it seems the presence of their bodies contribute to maintaining the humidity. Without a doubt they are cousins of other kinds of cold-blooded animals: toads, frogs. But when they go out, they are
                not the same. They deserve more credit for getting out there, because they have more trouble in doing so.
            </P>
            <P>
                Note that though they love the damp earth, they are not fond of those places that favor water, like bogs or ponds. And certainly they prefer solid ground, on the condition that it is rich and moist.
            </P>
            <P>
                They are also keen on vegetables and plants with green leaves loaded with water. They know how to eat leaving only the ribs, carving out the tenderest parts. They are the ultimate scourge of salads.
            </P>
            <P>
                What lies at the bottom of the pits? Some beings who like them for certain qualities have no intention of going down there. They have an element that is both constitutive and wandering. There also, just as much as in the daylight on a firm path, the shells
                protect them.
            </P>
            <P>
                Sure, it is sometimes a bother to always carry this shell along, but they don’t complain about it and ultimately, it makes them quite content. It is precious, wherever one finds oneself, to have the power to retreat within and defy interlopers. It is
                well worth the trouble.
            </P>
            <P>
                They drool with pride at this ability, at this convenience. How is it that I am a being so sensitive and vulnerable, and at the same time a shelter from the assaults of intruders, and in possession of this happiness and tranquility? Hence the marvelous
                posture.
            </P>
            <P>
                I adhere to the ground, so tenderly and slowly, so gradual and capable of un-sticking myself from the soil to return within but damn the consequences, a kick can send me rolling anywhere. I can always reestablish my footing, reattaching to the ground
                wherever I am relegated and finding my pasture: the soil, the most common of all nourishment.
            </P>
            <P>
                What happiness, what joy it is to be a snail. But this slobber of egotism is left upon everything the snail touches. A silver trail follows them. And perhaps this is a signal to the beak of birds that are fond of them. Here’s the hiccup, the question,
                to be or not to be (for the vain), the danger.
            </P>
            <P>
                Alone, evidently the snail is alone. He doesn’t have a lot of friends. But he doesn’t need them for his happiness. He adheres well to nature, he welcomes it so perfectly and so closely, he is a lover of the soil who kisses it with his whole body, and
                of the leaves, and of the sky that he raises his head towards so proudly with his sensitive eye globes; nobility, slowness, sagacity, pride, vanity, arrogance.
            </P>
            <P>
                And we cannot say that he resembles a pig. No, he doesn’t have the petty little feet, the worried scurrying. This emergency, this disgraceful fleeing all of a sudden. More resistance, and more stoicism. More methodical, more prideful and undoubtedly less
                gluttonous – less caprice; leaving this food for another, less panic and predilection towards overindulgence, less fear of losing something.
            </P>
            <P>
                Nothing is as beautiful as this method of advancing so slowly and surely and discreetly, the price of such efforts glisten perfectly wherever he has honored the ground! Just like a long boat with a silver wake. This fashion of procession is majestic,
                especially when one recalls the vulnerability, and the sensitive orbs of sight.
            </P>
            <P>
                Is the anger of snails discernable? Are there any examples? As this emotion is without a gesture, it surely manifests itself solely by a secretion of spit, which is more flocculent and faster. This drool of pride. One sees here the expression of anger
                is the same as that of vanity. This way, they reassure themselves and impose upon the world through a method that is more rich and silvery.
            </P>
            <P>
                The expression of their anger, just like their pride, becomes shiny upon drying. But also it creates a trail and designs for their captors (the predators). Moreover, it is ephemeral and lasts only until the next rain.
            </P>
            <P>
                They are like those who express themselves in a fashion that is entirely subjective and unrepentant, by light traces only, without worrying of the construction or creating their form as a solid domicile in multiple dimensions. More durable than themselves.
            </P>
            <P>
                But without a doubt the snails don’t feel this need. They are more like heros – which is to say those beings whose existence is the same as a work of art – than artists, who make the works of art.
            </P>
            <P>
                But here I touch on one of the principal points of the lesson, which is moreover not particular only to snails, but a possession in common with with all other shell creatures: the shell is part of their being and at the same time a work of art, a monument.
                It lasts much longer than the insides.
            </P>
            <P>
                And that is the example they give us. Saints, they make their art their life – the art of their perfection. Their secretion is produced even in the same manner that it is formed. Nothing outside themselves, outside their necessities, outside their needs
                is their work. Nothing of disproportion – on the other hand – of their physicality. Nothing that is, to them, unnecessary or obligatory.
            </P>
            <P>
                In this way, they draw from man and his work. Grand thoughts come from the heart. Perfect your morality and you will create beautiful poetry. Morality and rhetoric join up with the ambitions and desires of the wise.
            </P>
            <P>
                Yet saints in what way? In precisely obeying their own nature. So, know yourself first. And accept yourself as you are. In accordance with your vices. In proportion to your measure.
            </P>
            <P>
                But what is the proper notion of man? Language and morality. Humanism.
            </P>
